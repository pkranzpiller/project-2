## AIDB (Anime Interactive Database)
A full-stack web application that will allow users to rate and review anime, as well as see
other people's ratings and reviews. Will use some form of Anime API (API Choice TBD).

# User Stories
- [] As a user, I want to be able to login as a writer or a moderator, so I can post reviews, rate shows, (in the case of moderators, do my job.
- [] As a user, I want to see other people's reviews on individual anime, so I can see what other individuals think about only the shows I'm interested in.
- [] As a user, I want to see what other people (on average) rate individual shows, because I want to know what the community thinks of these shows.
- [] As a user, I want the average ratings to be represented graphically, because that makes it faster for me to see what the community thinks.
- [] As a user, I want to be able to do all of the above without logging in, as I don't necessarily want to write or moderate reviews.
- [] As a writer, I want to be able to post reviews of anime I have seen, because I want other users to know my opinions.
- [] As a writer, I want to be able to rate individual shows on a scale of 1-star to 5-star, because I want people to be able to clearly see what the community thinks of individual anime.
- [] As a moderator, I want to be able to delete reviews, as I want to make sure other users won't be forced to see spoilers or inappropriate information.
- [] As a moderator, I want the ability to ban writers, as I want to keep the community here free from toxic influences.
